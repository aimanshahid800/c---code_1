This C++ program is a scientific calculator that can perform various arithmetic operations and currency conversions. Here’s a brief description of its functionalities:

Arithmetic Operations: The program can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square, square root, cube, percentage, factorial, power, sine, cosine, tangent, logarithm calculations, and age calculations.

Currency Conversions: The program can convert between different currencies such as US Dollar, Pakistani Rupee, Indian Rupee, Euro, Yuan, Dirham, Yen, UK Pound, Riyal, Dinar, and Swiss Franc.

To use the program, the user is prompted to enter a choice to perform an operation or conversion. For arithmetic operations, the user is asked to input the numbers on which the operation will be performed. For currency conversions, the user is asked to input the amount to be converted.

Please note that this program uses cin for input and cout for output, which are standard C++ methods for console input and output. It also uses the cmath library for mathematical operations such as square root, power, sine, cosine, and tangent.

This program is a great tool for performing quick calculations and currency conversions. However, it should be noted that the currency conversion rates are hardcoded and may not reflect the current exchange rates. For accurate currency conversions, it’s recommended to use an API that provides real-time exchange rates.

Also, please note that this program does not handle exceptions or errors that may occur during the execution, such as division by zero or invalid input. It’s recommended to add error handling to improve the robustness of the program.
